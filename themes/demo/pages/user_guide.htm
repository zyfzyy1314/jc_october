            <p>Welcome to the Algoal365 user guide! The Algoal365 website is a user friendly application that can take a short time to explore and understand.  While this user guide only covers a fraction of the website, it will give you a great head-start in understanding the site's functionality and underlying rationale.</p>
            <p>Algoal365 is entirely focused on curating financing-market information for traders. The nature of this information is primarily real-time (i.e., what's happening right now), and the scope ranges from economic data to analysis from members.</p>
            <p>Algoal365 hosts three main functions: Calendar, News, and Add to website. There's a link to each of these products in the header of every page.</p>
