Modern EU law requires sites to let the user know if cookies are stored on their
computer. This is a simple solution for following this law.

This plugin integrates the popular Cookie Consent tool in your theme. It requires
the theme to have the `scripts` placeholder since that is where we inject the
configuration and the third-party script from [SilkTide](https://silktide.com/tools/cookie-consent/).

# Usage

Simply configure the settings from the backend interface and then it automatically
runs on the frontend.
